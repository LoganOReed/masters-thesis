\noindent In this thesis we introduce a numerical approach adapted to the minimization of the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian with respect to the Dirichlet boundary condition on a polygonal domain of fixed area.
We utilize the method of fundamental solutions and a standard descent method to optimize the first eigenvalue with respect to the vertices of the domain.
This algorithm enables us to study the validity of the Pólya-Szegő conjecture for polygons with five or more sides, which has remained open since $1950$.
We also prove some properties of the Dirichlet eigenvalues when we have a polygonal domain.
