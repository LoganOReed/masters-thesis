* Overall Tasks
** TODO Pick Key Theorems as Roadmap for Structure
*** TODO Keep References and Page Numbers

* Questions [0/5]
** TODO Should I focus on the pentagonal cases or the mathematics behind the code
*** Should I touch on both?
** TODO How Much Detail should I go into for the background knowledge
*** What percentage of the paper should the intro be, prereqs, etc.
** TODO Is there a good rule of thumb for when to include a proof and when to just cite a source
** TODO What should I ask the other professors for refereeing or whatever they are doing
*** And what are they doing?
** TODO Do you have a list of style/flavor guides for writing other than ryans thesis.

* Audience
First year graduates and professors outside of the field.
